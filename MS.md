### Ongoing research

With the support of the Clinical Research Priority Program's <a href="https://www.precisionms.uzh.ch/en.html">PrecisionMS</a> , I am involved with research in the area of Multiple Sclerosis. I contribute to study design and analysis in clinician-led projects, as well as initiate my own research. 

Stay tuned for information on my prediction modeling projects.
