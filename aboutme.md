My name is Kelly Reeve.

### My story

I'm a biostatistician at the University of Zurich's EBPI. I'm currently working on my PhD in Biostatistics (supervision of Prof. Dr. Ulrike Held) with a focus on clinical prediction modeling. I've worked on consulting projects, big and small, from design to analysis, for clinicians at the University Hospital Zurich and have also undertaken a large joint project on automatic disease surveillance with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.
