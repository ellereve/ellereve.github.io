My name is Kelly Reeve.

### My story

I'm a biostatistician at the University of Zurich's EBPI. I've worked on consulting projects, big and small, from design to analysis, for clinicians at the University Hospital Zurich. I've also undertaken a large joint project on automatic disease surveillance with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. I'm currently working on my PhD in the Biostatistics (supervision of PD Dr. Ulrike Held) with a focus on clinical prediction modeling.
