My name is Kelly Reeve.

### My story

I'm a biostatistician at the University of Zurich's Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (<a href="https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en.html">EBPI</a>). I'm currently working on my PhD in biostatistics (under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/departments/biostatistics/teambiostats/held_ulrike.html">Prof. Dr. Ulrike Held</a>) with a focus on clinical prediction modeling. 

Previously, I worked within the consulting department of the EBPI on projects big and small, from design to analysis, for clinicians at the University Hospital Zurich. I have also undertaken a large joint project on <a href="https://ellereve.github.io/Reeve_PosterA0_BAG_v2c.pdf">automatic disease surveillance</a> with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. 

Feel free to contact me :)
