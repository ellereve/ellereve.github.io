My name is Kelly Reeve.

### My story

I'm a biostatistician at the University of Zurich's Epidimiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI). I'm currently working on my PhD in biostatistics (under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ulrike Held) with a focus on clinical prediction modeling. 

Previously, I worked within the consulting department of the EBPI on projects big and small, from design to analysis, for clinicians at the University Hospital Zurich. I have also undertaken a large joint project on automatic disease surveillance with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. 

Feel free to contract me :)
