### Cochrane Prognostic Model Review

I would love to tell you that this behemoth of a project has been successfully published by the Cochrane organization, but sadly that is not the case. If you believe in reproducible research, I highly suggest you steer clear of this organization. The workflows are counterproductive and beaureaucracy trumps science.

### Open Projects

A large focus of mine at the moment is prediction of post-operative delirium: it is prevalent, it is underappreciated and underdiagnosed, it is associated with negative long-term outcomes, and there are ways to help prevent it once a person is identified as at-risk.
